# Countable Choice implies Postnikov Effectiveness
Contains a formal proof of the theorem that countable choice implies postnikov effectiveness in HoTT

This is based on the proofs of lemmas 3.1 and 3.4 in [Choice axioms and Postnikov completeness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19772) by Mathieu Anel and Reid Barton.


Main theorem is contained in "ChoicePostnikov.agda"

"Preliminary.agda" is independent of the rest of the code and contains an early outline of the proof

TODO: general cleaning up, especially in Limits and DiagramSigma files; add some ascii diagrams; delete Preliminary.agda?
